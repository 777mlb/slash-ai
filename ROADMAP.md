# Slash AI Roadmap

## üéØ Top Priority

### Context-Aware Prompts
- **Page Context Integration**: Ability to include page content as background information
- For example, if a user is using Slash AI in Gmail, we should read the email thread of the page they're on so they can say "finish this email" or "respond to this email" and Slash AI's response will be good
- Automatically pull relevant context from the current page/selection
- Toggle option to include/exclude context per prompt

### Saved Prompts System
- **Custom Prompt Library**: User-created reusable prompts
- Quick access via `/ai /sales-email` syntax
- Categories and organization for prompt management

### Highlight to Add AI
- If we come back to the core use case, it's that we want the ability for a team to share system-wide prompts and have those impact how users interact with their content
- For example, we might have a prompt that checks an email for certain qualities before it goes to customers or a prompt that checks a LinkedIn post for certain grammar qualities before it goes to customers
- Currently the process is to write something, copy it into ChatGPT, remember the prompt, get a result and copy it back into the page
- Instead, what if the user writes in their tool of choice (e.g. Gmail), then highlights the text, selects a prompt, it provides feedback and if you like it will override the text?

## üêõ Known Bugs

### Notion Overlay Positioning
- Core functionality works (text insertion, slash commands)
- Modal overlay appears in top-left corner instead of near cursor
- Need to fix overlay positioning for Notion's contentEditable structure

## üöÄ Feature Requests

### User Experience (UX)

#### Dark Mode Support
- Current overlay styling looks good in Gmail light mode
- Breaks/looks poor on dark mode sites (e.g., Google in dark mode)
- Need adaptive styling that detects page theme or uses CSS media queries

#### Enhanced Visual Indicators
- ‚úÖ Already shows "Esc to cancel" hint
- Consider improving the visual hierarchy and accessibility of these hints

### Functionality


#### Model Selection
- Allow users to toggle between different AI models
- Support for different OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, etc.)
- Model selection UI in overlay or options page


#### Text Blaze-Style Shortcuts
- Non-AI shortcuts for common text expansions
- Custom shortcuts like `/email` ‚Üí email signature
- User-defined text replacement shortcuts

#### Conversation Mode
- **Interactive Chat**: Multi-turn conversation before final insertion
- Preview/edit AI response before inserting
- Chat interface within the overlay for back-and-forth
- Final "Insert" button to place refined response


#### Team Prompt Sharing
- **Shared Prompt Libraries**: Company/team-wide prompt collections
- Cloud sync for team prompts
- Permission management (view/edit/admin)

#### Prompt Versioning
- **Version Control**: Track changes to team prompts over time
- Rollback capability to previous prompt versions
- Change history and diff viewing
- Safe updates without breaking existing workflows
